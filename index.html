        <h2>About Naming System</h2>
        <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 
            'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names. The table shows the names given to either male or female depending on the day they were born.
